### Goal and Value of the Application
The application is a bakery shop app that allows the users to purchase baked goods from a set menu.The app includes a sorting and filter mechanism that shows the users all the items in the shop in a price-descending or ascending orders. The mechanism also allows the page to exhibit items in a particular baked goods catergory (cakes, desserts and etc.). By adding the wanted items into the cart, the users can see the quantities of each goods they are purchasing and the final total price including the shipping costs. 

### Usability Principles Considered
-> Efficiency: by putting both a remove and add button in each card, we allow the users to change quantities of their desired gods in the most efficient manner. The total price automatically calculated for users in the cart also facilitate the check out process.
-> Controllability / customizability: by providing three orders for sorting and four catergories for filtering, the app gives much controls to the users to exhibit the items they desire.
-> Consistency: all the buttons deployed use MUI package to keep the page's element as consistent as possible. 
-> Feedback: every operation that the users do on the page receive visual feedbacks (element updates in the filter/sort menu and cart)

### Organization of Components
The organization of components in this application uses object-oriented programming schedme. There are 6 components: header, main, basket, filter, product,
